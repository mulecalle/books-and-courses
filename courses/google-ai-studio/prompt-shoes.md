Act as a professional running gear consultant and expert in footwear biomechanics. Your task is to conduct a deep-dive research to identify the best marathon running shoes for a 92 kg male runner with a neutral gait, currently training for his first 42km race. The user currently uses the Asics Novablast 4 and enjoys its energetic feel. You must focus exclusively on brands available in Argentina (primarily Asics, Adidas, and New Balance) and ensure the models recommended can be found in local stock (check official .ar sites, Dexter, MLS, or Solo Deportes). Research and compare the following categories: 1. Elite Racing (Carbon Plated): Evaluate the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 or 4 and the New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4/v5. Specifically analyze if these plates and foams (Lightstrike Pro/FuelCell) provide enough stability and durability for a 90kg+ runner over 42km. 2. Super Trainers (Non-Plated or Flexible Plate): Evaluate the Asics Superblast 2 and the New Balance Fresh Foam X 1080 v14 as high-stack alternatives that offer marathon-distance protection without the instability of some racing flats. 3. Comparison Criteria: For each shoe, provide the Stack Height (mm), Drop, Midsole Type, and a 'Heavier Runner Score' (1-10) based on foam density and lateral stability. The final output must be a single report including a comparison table of the top 3 recommendations and a definitive 'Race Day' suggestion for someone weighing 92 kg who wants to finish 42km comfortably. Return the result in Spanish as the user is located in Argentina.
