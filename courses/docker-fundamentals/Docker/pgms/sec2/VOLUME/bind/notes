                        VOLUME Instruction
                           Bind Mounts

1.  Show file in host directory.

    $ cat data/file.txt
    This is line 1.

2.  Run detached volc container, keep running with tail command.
    Bind source data dir to target /app directory in volc container.

    $ docker run -d --name volc --mount type=bind,
        source="$(pwd)"/data,target=/app alpine tail -f /dev/null 

3.  Show volc container running.

    $ docker ps
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND           NAME
    5bd0eb407287   alpine   "tail -f /dev/null"   volc
  
4.  Show host file has been mapped to container.

    $ docker exec volc cat /app/file.txt
    This is line 1.

5.  Enter container and put another line in /app/file.txt.

    $ docker exec -it volc sh
    / # ls
    app    dev    home   media  opt    root   sbin   sys    usr
    bin    etc    lib    mnt    proc   run    srv    tmp    var
    / # echo "This is line 2." >> app/file.txt
    / # exit

6.  Verify that file has been updated in host code directory.

    $ cat data/file.txt
    This is line 1.
    This is line 2.

7.  Cleanup

    $ docker stop volc 
    $ docker container prune -f
    $ docker image prune -f
